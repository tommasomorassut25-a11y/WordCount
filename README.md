# File Reader and Simple Analyzer

This small Python program reads a text file and provides a simple interactive menu to view or analyze its contents.

Features
- Display the full contents of a file.
- Analyze the file: count words, punctuation symbols (.,;:!?), spaces, and total characters.

Requirements
- Python 3.x

Usage
1. Put the text to analyze in `input.txt` (the repository includes an example containing "Ciao!").
2. Run the program:

```bash
python app.py
```

Menu options
- `1` — Read and show the file content
- `2` — Analyze the file (word count, symbols, spaces, letters)
- `3` — Exit the program

Notes
- The program is intentionally small and uses a basic text-splitting and character scan for analysis.
